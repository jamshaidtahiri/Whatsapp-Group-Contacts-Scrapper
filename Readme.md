## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you are logged into your WhatsApp Web account before running the script.
2. Close all other Chrome browser tabs to prevent any interference during the scraping process.

## Chrome WebDriver

1. Download the Chrome WebDriver compatible with your Chrome browser version from [here](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/).
